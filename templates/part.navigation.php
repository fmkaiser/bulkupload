	By transparently splitting big files into smaller chunks, the bulk upload app allows you to upload files of an arbitrary size - as long as there is enough free space in your workspace. <br/><br/>
	Files will be uploaded to <strong>/bulkupload</strong>, from where you can move them later.<br/><br/>
